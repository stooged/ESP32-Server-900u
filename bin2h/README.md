# Bin 2 H

this tool allows you to generate the `goldhen.h` file from the `goldhen.bin` file.

you just drag and drop the goldhen.bin file onto the `bin2h_exe.bat` if you do not have python installed or `bin2h_python.bat` if you have python and wish to use that.

the .bin file will be compressed with gzip during the conversion process to save space.

once finished you will have a `goldhen.h` file that you can use in the server project for the INTHEN function.
